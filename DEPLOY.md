# Game Market - Static Site Deploy

## Deploy Instructions

### Option 1: Netlify (Recommended)
1. Go to https://app.netlify.com/
2. Click "Add new site" → "Deploy manually"
3. Drag and drop the entire `d:\web1` folder
4. Netlify will host all files including videos

### Option 2: GitHub Releases
Videos are too large for GitHub repository. They are stored locally and work when running the site locally.

## Local Development
Open `index.html` in a browser or use Live Server extension in VS Code.
